# 1. Applying a Circuit Breaker to Tackle COVID-19
On 3 Apr, strict “circuit breaker” measures were announced by Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong and the Multi-Ministry Taskforce (MTF) to pre-empt the trend of increasing local transmission of COVID-19. The elevated set of measures was necessary because despite best efforts, there had been more than 50 new cases daily and an increasing number of locally transmitted cases. Also, several clusters in foreign worker dormitories and a nursing home have emerged.

## Stay Home, Stay Safe

The measures, which will be in place from 7 Apr to 4 May, include:

*   Closing most workplaces premises, except essential services or key economic sectors which are critical for local and global supply chains.
*   Full home-based learning for schools and Institutes of Higher Learning. 
*   Closing recreation venues, attractions and places of worship. 
*   Barring social gatherings.

MOH also issued a news release on 3 Apr, asking all Singaporeans to minimise movements and interactions in public and private places, and stay home in order to effectively slow the spread of infection. If people must go out to purchase daily necessities, essential services, or for urgent medical needs, safe distancing should be practised.  

**_"Each and every one of us can, and must do our part, to keep everyone in Singapore safe from COVID-19.”_** -        
– PM Lee Hsien Loong on 3 Apr

# 2. Building Resilience and Emerging Stronger

![](/assets/Picture 5.png)

While COVID-19 has severely diminished global production capacities and disrupted global supply chains, in an oral reply in Parliament on 6 Apr, Minister for Trade and Industry Chan Chun Sing shared Singapore’s multi-pronged strategy to deal with the disruption: 

*  **Stockpiling, import diversification, and local production** to ensure its food supply.  
*  **Working with like-minded partners.** Trading lines with countries like China and South Korea remain open, and a recent agreement with six countries like Australia, Brunei and Canada ensures supply chain connectivity for goods and essential supplies. 

Deputy Prime Minister Heng Swee Keat in Parliament also said on 7 Apr that economic shocks and border closures caused by COVID-19 and the stringent measures put in place will have a big impact on Singapore’s economy. 

**_"The question we should ask ourselves even now is when (the recovery) comes what sort of world it will be, and how ready Singapore will be to march forward again.”_** - 
– DPM Heng Swee Keat in Parliament on 7 Apr 

He added that Singapore’s best response now is to build resilience in our economy and society. Key measures to do that are: 

*  **Two additional support packages** were announced – the S$48.4 billion Resilience Budget and S$5.1 billion Solidarity Budget. These will help viable businesses preserve their capabilities to recover and affected workers to make the best use of this downtime. 
*  A **new Emerging Stronger Task Force** focusing on economic resilience will be set up. Chaired by Minister for Social and Family Development Desmond Lee and PSA International group chief executive Tan Chong Meng, the task force will look for ways that can help Singapore’s economy bounce back from the COVID-19 crisis and be ready to ride the wave of demand when it happens.
